# python-learning-path
My road to Top 1% Python Developer. A comprehensive collection of projects, scripts, and exercises from top industry certifications and self-directed learning.

# 🧬 From Pipette to Python: The Bio-Digital Learning Path

> **"Don't use AI to skip learning. Use AI to accelerate it."**

## 🚀 The Mission
I am a **Senior Lab Technologist (15 years exp.)** transitioning into a **Top 1% Python Developer**. This repository is a **Proof of Work**. It documents my journey of translating biological logic into digital code, powered by the **Google & Samsung Ecosystem**.

## 🎓 The Educational Pipeline
My learning path is structured and certified. I combine general AI knowledge with specialized medical applications.

* ✅ **FOUNDATION (Completed):**
    * **Google AI Professional Certificates** - Core concepts of AI & Machine Learning.
* 🔄 **SPECIALIZATION (Current Focus):**
    * **Stanford University (Coursera):** *AI in Healthcare*.
    * *Focus:* Medical Imaging, EHR Data Analysis, Genomics.
* 📅 **ADVANCED (Planned):**
    * **DeepLearning.AI:** Advanced Algorithms.
    * **IBM:** Data Science Refinement.

## ⚙️ The "Trinity" Workflow
This project is powered by a custom AI ecosystem running on **Samsung DeX**:

1.  **INPUT (The Translation):** My custom **"Bio-Digital Mentor"** Gem translates academic concepts (from Stanford/Google) into Laboratory Analogies (e.g., *Dataframes* = *Patient Charts*).
2.  **PROCESS (The Lab):**
    * **Local:** *Pydroid 3* on Android for offline scripting (The "Field Kit").
    * **Cloud:** *Google Colab* for heavy data processing & Jupyter Notebooks (The "Main Lab").
3.  **OUTPUT (The Archive):** Code pushed via mobile to GitHub.

## 🛠️ Tech Stack & Hardware
* **Hardware (The Ultra Setup):**
    * Samsung Galaxy **Tab S11 Ultra** + DeX Mode (Main Station).
    * Samsung Galaxy **S-Series Ultra** (Mobile Operations).
* **Environment:**
    * **IDE:** Pydroid 3 & Google Colab.
    * **AI Core:** Gemini Advanced (Trinity Ecosystem).
* **Language:** Python 3.x (Pandas, NumPy, TensorFlow basics).

## 📂 Repository Structure
* `00_Certificates/` - Proof of completed Google courses.
* `01_Genesis_Protocol/` - Python Basics translated to Bio-Logic.
* `02_Stanford_AI_Labs/` - Practical assignments from the AI in Healthcare specialization.
* `03_Bio_Playground/` - Experiments with real-world medical scenarios (using dummy data).
* `99_Universal_Workbench/` - The catch-all zone. Random scripts, snippets, general tests, and uncategorized code.
